## 🚨 CRITICAL EDGE CASES DISCOVERED

### 1. [HIGH PRIORITY] Very Large Numbers Accepted
- **Issue:** Application accepts extremely large numbers without validation
- **Impact:** Could cause calculation overflow, display issues, or database problems
- **Example:** Numbers like 999999999999999999999 are accepted
- **Fix Required:** Add reasonable amount limits (e.g., max $1,000,000)

### 2. [HIGH PRIORITY] Negative Amounts Accepted  
- **Issue:** Negative values accepted in amount fields
- **Impact:** Could confuse expense/income logic and break calculations
- **Example:** -$500 expenses could be entered
- **Fix Required:** Validate amounts are positive or handle negative amounts explicitly

### 3. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Invalid Date Formats Accepted
- **Issue:** Application accepts malformed date inputs
- **Impact:** Could cause data integrity issues and sorting problems
- **Example:** Dates like "invalid-date" or "99/99/9999" 
- **Fix Required:** Add client-side date validation

### 4. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Very Long Text Inputs Allowed
- **Issue:** No character limits on text fields
- **Impact:** Could cause performance issues, UI overflow, database problems
- **Example:** 10,000+ character titles and descriptions accepted
- **Fix Required:** Add character limits (e.g., 255 chars for titles, 1000 for descriptions)

### 5. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Complex Unicode Characters
- **Issue:** Unicode characters like emojis and special symbols accepted
- **Impact:** Could cause display or database storage issues
- **Example:** Names with 🎉💰🔥 and complex Unicode characters
- **Fix Required:** Test database storage and UI display of Unicode

### 6. [LOW PRIORITY] Rapid Form Submissions Possible
- **Issue:** No debouncing on form submissions
- **Impact:** Could create duplicate entries if user clicks multiple times
- **Fix Required:** Add debouncing or loading states to prevent rapid clicks

### 7. [LOW PRIORITY] Email Validation Relies Only on HTML5
- **Issue:** Basic email validation could allow invalid emails
- **Impact:** Could allow malformed emails to register
- **Example:** Emails like "test@" might pass basic validation
- **Fix Required:** Add comprehensive email validation regex

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (Critical - Fix Before Production)
1. **Add Amount Validation**
   ```javascript
   const validateAmount = (amount) => {
     const num = parseFloat(amount);
     return num > 0 && num <= 1000000; // Max $1M
   };
   ```

2. **Implement Negative Number Prevention**
   ```javascript
   const handleAmountChange = (e) => {
     const value = e.target.value;
     if (parseFloat(value) < 0) {
       setError('Amount must be positive');
       return;
     }
   };
   ```

### Priority 2 (Important - Fix Soon)
3. **Add Date Validation**
   ```javascript
   const validateDate = (dateString) => {
     const date = new Date(dateString);
     return date instanceof Date && !isNaN(date);
   };
   ```

4. **Implement Character Limits**
   ```javascript
   <input 
     maxLength={255} 
     title="Maximum 255 characters"
   />
   ```

### Priority 3 (Enhancement - Future Sprint)
5. **Add Debouncing for Form Submissions**
6. **Enhance Email Validation**
7. **Test Unicode Character Support**
